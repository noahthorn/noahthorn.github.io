I found [pmohackbook.org](pmohackbook.org) this week, which outlines, in 80 or so pages, a method for quitting pornography use. It claims to work by revealing the underlying mechanisms of porn. By the end, the illusions that fuel your addiction will be laid bare, and porn's true emptiness and utter lack of utility will be revealed.

A couple days later, idiosyncratic artist [@owenbroadcast](https://twitter.com/owenbroadcast) published a brilliant comic detailing his own experiences with sex, porn, and their demonic interactions. The early panels describe young Owen's surreal (yet normal) descent into watching hardcore porn regularly. "Seems kind of crazy in retrospect," the text reads on a red-washed frame of Owen, eaten by the office chair at a mere 11 years old, hypnotized by a screen showing a woman's head hovering over another woman's panties. I recognized that kid and that image; when I began using, I only looked at lesbian scenes because I thought it was gay to look at a dick.

Our modern world presented me with formative sexual experiences absent of human interaction, long before I was ready. The internet asked me who I was and began to answer for me simultaneously as I found ways past my dad's (bless his soul) porn filter.

I've used porn since and have tried to quit numerous times. It's not all-consuming &mdash; maybe not even an addiction anymore. It's just a vice that sometimes convinces me to come back. But the really nefarious thing about pornography are its subtle effects on the psyche. Pornographic images linger in your mind longer than almost anything else. Your mind has this ever expanding carousel projector that's filled with shocking images of hardcore sex that will, at random, click on and flash your cortex, bewildering you into a flushed face and bitter resentment. I'll see pictures of myself at a party from three years ago that I can't remember being taken, but I'll be damned if that projector doesn't flash, in 4K, cunnilingus I watched on dimmed phone screen, hunched under my covers at age 14.

The final panels of Owen's reflection consider the plight of the lonely under social pressure. A girl goes out to hook up because she thinks she should, and returns in the early hours to cry in her room; "Oh my God what the fuck is wrong with me." We see the red-wash fill her room underneath the closed door, stark against the blank whiteness of the hall outside.

A synchronicity presented me with an old post on [fluland](https://web.archive.org/web/20180110043347/http://www.fluland.com/2017/02/25/finding-love-in-the-age-of-the-bug-by-john-doe/), scraped by the WayBack Machine and written by a Cid Barret, co-opting the name of the lost [Pink Floyd frontman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Barrett). He writes about the girl locked away in the red-washed room:

> Desperately adrift in an alienating world, this young woman, barely older than a child, was freefalling through life desperately reaching out for something, anything, the only way she knew how; fucking.

I went to my first party at 19 in a dirty frathouse loft. My first beer was a natty light and it was the only thing in their kegs, so I didn't get drunk. I met a red-haired freshman named Emma, and we sat on the fire escape with our legs hanging off and talked for an hour. She kept saying I reminded of her best friend from high school, a Jordan she was sad to part with. She kept saying that.

She was drunk, or so she told me, so I walked her back to her dorm. She wanted to have sex. I sat in her dorm with her and she laid her head on my lap and I couldn't look her in the eyes. The room was so bright under the fluorescent overheads. Eventually I left and I never saw her again.

I've never had casual sex, but I wanted it. For the two years I was at that university, I was haunted by the thought that I should get laid, made worse by a suddenly sprouting [social anxiety]({% post_url 2019-02-19-kath %}) that prevented me from talking to strangers unless I was sloshed. I was a heavy porn user during that time. My carousel projector made any interactions difficult. Here's what the hackbook says about that carousel &mdash; the "little monster:"

> A non-[porn]-user doesn’t suffer from this unsatisfied state, completely relaxed after a no-sex date, while the user isn’t until they having satisfied their ’little monster’.

The telos for interaction became sex. I feedbacked myself into anxiety as I paradoxically desired genuine connection and a quickie. Eventually it became easier to simply avoid interaction and just settle into loneliness. In my sophomore year I dropped out of most of my classes and became a part-time student, spending most of my time locked in my red-washed room.

Pornography, like most vice, is medication. "I remember why I took this drug in the first place," Barret writes. "To medicate. To medicate my weirdness and my otherness. To slave myself to my sexual desires, in order to free myself of the burden of awareness. In other words, I took it to stop thinking, so I could get laid." In _[la petite mort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_petite_mort)_, your consciousness expires, however briefly, and you grasp with clarity how sweet nihilism could be. But then you're back, and you're not nihilist, and you're just laying there alone, a sock in your hand and a lotion bottle moved from where you think it's inconspicuous on your dresser to your nightstand.
